      <blockquote>
			<p>In addition to User ID and Password based security, RETS 
        uses a standard form of encryption known as MD5. </p>
      <p> Standards efforts do not always include a description 
        of how to transmit data. RETS defines both how to <i>describe</i> the 
        data and how to <i>transmit</i> the data.</p>
      <p> By doing so, RETS was able to be more rapidly deployed 
        and used than has been the case in many other standards efforts to date.</p>

        always provides your developers or vendors a view of what is happening 
        behind the scenes, making it much easier to implement RETS for your applications.

      <p>Real estate offices may represent a single real estate 
        broker, or there may more than one office per broker for that market. 
        Typically, MLS's emphasize the office more than the broker as a means 
        for sorting and searching.</p>

      <blockquote>
			<p>RETS protects the user database by NOT allowing developers 
        to directly access the data behind the RETS Server. Developers must create 
        queries using a RETS query language called DMQL - it limits the nature 
        of what a developer can do with the data in a database. This also allows 
        RETS to work with databases that may not use the standard SQL database 
        language (e.g. legacy mainframe systems at banks).</p>
      <p> The Default Query shown on this page can be altered. 
        Try changing the StreetName from *AVE to *ST . </p>
      <p> Of course, no user-friendly system nowadays requires 
        users to create such queries. Developers using RETS would typically write 
        a client interface to hide such details. <br>
        <br>
        Our goal here was to show developers how the formatting works and what 
        happens when it is executed.</p>

			<p>The table contains three hyperlinks for each record, shown 
        as <u><font color="#003399">blue underlined text.</font></u> Selecting 
        the hyperlinks sends additional search transactions to the RETS Server. 
        Selecting a hyperlink in &quot;Listing Agent ID&quot; column performs 
        a Search Agent Transaction for the agent who's id matches the selected 
        Listing Agent ID. Selecting a hyperlink in the &quot;City&quot; column 
        performs a Search Property Transaction for all listings for the selected 
        city. Selecting a hyperlink in the Zip column performs search for listings 
        in the selected zip code.</p>
